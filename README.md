# Breaking Bad App
## :computer: About
Breaking Bad app developed with Swift language. I used Kingfisher, Activity indicator and Alert view as 3rd party library. 
In terms of its general structure, the application consists of 3 pages on the tab bar. Characters are displayed on the first page, 
chapters on the second page, and the imdb website of the directory on the third page. I used Urlsession for network operations.
